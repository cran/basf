Title: Plot Simple Features with 'base' Sensibilities
Description: Resurrects the standard plot for shapes established by the
 'base' and 'graphics' packages. This is suited to workflows that require
 plotting using the established and traditional idioms of plotting spatially
 coincident data where it belongs. This package depends on 'sf' and only replaces 
 the plot method.
